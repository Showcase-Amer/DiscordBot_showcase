This is a showcase version, it was devlopped on a account that I want to keep private. 
Another person was a major contributor but he also like to stay private.

So the bot was devlopped to manage a game's pick up games. 
Pick up games is an organized game for high level players to compete privately in custom lobbies .
The bots manages the teams, capitain, maps, reward and multiple games.



This is not a runable version, alot of part have been cut to simplifie the showcase. 
The bot was devlopped for a specific discord server. In other words, 
the code wasnt written in a way to be shared in public. specific channel, 
user and server ids are used and saved. For those reasons, 
most of the cogs will be empty and all the json files have been deleted.

========> Those cogs are left untouched :  Slots,maps, connectfour, buytickets and codes <========================

The utilities of the cog are :

-banners.py is made to manage the custom banner of ui.

-codes.py generate custom codes for people to redeem. 

-Coinflip.py is a 50% coinflip. -Connectfour.py is simply the connect four game. 

-dice.py is just a roll of dice. -Hangman.py is just hangman.

-buyticket.py is settup to sell ticket for players for an special event 

-Inventory.py manages the player inventory. For example, tickets. 

-id.py manage players ids and accounts with the bot. It tracks player history, winnings and rewards. 

-Philjack.py is just black jack -jackpotresults.py to determine the winner. -maps.py is just a random map picker. 

-match.py is a game's result tracker. 

-memory.py is a reward system based on frequency of participation 

-party.py create parties for people to play mini games in the discord server 

-philerfunctions.py is just a module that has all the important function needed to run the bot. 

-profile.py is the ui. 

-raceleaderboard.py kept track of the score for a special event for Xmas. 

-redeem.py manages the redeems of codes. the rest of the cogs/extentions are just mini games.
